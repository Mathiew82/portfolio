# Alberto Mateo – Portfolio

Personal portfolio built with a **simple, performant, and framework-free approach**.

The goal of this project is to keep things **clear, fast, and maintainable**, avoiding unnecessary complexity while focusing on real-world performance and good practices.

---

## Tech stack & decisions

- **HTML + TypeScript + SCSS**
- **Vite** as build tool (fast development and optimized production output)
- **No frameworks** (no Vue / React / etc.) by design  
  → simpler architecture, smaller bundle, and full control over the codebase

---

## Project structure

- src/main.ts // application entry point
- src/modules/ // isolated feature logic
- src/data/ // static data feeding the HTML
- src/types/ // TypeScript types
- src/scss/ // styles

---

## Key principles

- Minimal and easy-to-understand architecture
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Optimized and compressed images (size matters)
- No unnecessary libraries or abstractions
- Clean and readable UI over visual noise
- SEO-friendly, fast, and efficient

Built to be **simple, predictable, and fast**.
